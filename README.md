# Objectives:

* Implement and practice the use of HTML elements and attributes.

00. Create an index.html file, insert the basic elements needed to start a HTML file, this will include a DOCTYPE element, HTML elements, head elements and body elements. 
    * _**HINT:** There is a keyboard shortcut to complete this! Try researching "emmet abbreviations"._
01. Inside the &lt;body&gt; of your page, insert h1 through h6 elements, give each heading element some funny text.
02. Add a comment before each heading to give yourself a reminder what the purpose of that section should be.
03. Insert a div element, inside of the div insert x6 paragraph elements. Inside each, write a little bit about yourself.
04. Add an image after each paragraph in your page.
05. "Wrap" each section (heading, paragraph, and image) with a &lt;section&gt;tag. The open section tag should precede the first heading tag, and the closing section tag should be after the image tag.
    * _**REMEMBER:** Indent properly!_
    * _**HINT:** If your indentation ever gets out of whack, just right click anywhere in VS Code and click "format document"!_
06. In between every paragraph and image, create an unordered list with at least x3 list items. Again, the content contained in this list is up to you!
07. Create a form with x3inputs: first name, last name, and email address. Make sure each input is labeled, and that all of them are wrapped with form tags.
08. Add a button to the form using an input tag. 
    * _**HINT:** You may need to google html form submission._
09. Create an ordered list, give this list at least x5 things you're excited to learn about in Covalence.
010. Create an unordered list, give this list at least x5 interesting facts about yourself.
011. Wrap the entire page in a &lt;div&gt;.
012. Reformat the document. How does it change compared to what you had originally written? 
        * _**HINT:** You can use Command + 'Z' to undo and Command + Shift + 'Z' to redo on a Mac. On Windows it is Control + 'Z' to undo and Control + 'Y' to redo._
013. Add a horizontal line between each section in your document.
014. Add hyperlinks to each image that opens the image in a new tab.
